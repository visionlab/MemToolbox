% MemToolbox 1.0.0
%
% The MemToolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions for modeling visual
% working memory. In support of its goal to provide a full suite of data
% analysis tools, the toolbox includes implementations of popular models of
% visual working memory, real and simulated data sets, Bayesian and maximum
% likelihood estimation procedures for fitting models to data,
% visualizations of data and fit, validation routines, model comparison
% metrics, and experiment scripts. The MemToolbox is released under a BSD
% license and is freely available.
%
% To install the toolbox, just add the MemToolbox folder and all of the
% subfolders to your path. Setup.m is designed to do this for you.
%
% If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your
% research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed
% in MATLAB using the MemToolbox (Suchow, Brady, Fougnie & Alvarez, in press)."
%
