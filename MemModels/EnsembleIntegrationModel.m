% ENSEMBLEINTEGRATIONMODEL integration with distractors shifts reports
% Based on the model of Brady & Alvarez (2011), this model shifts
% observers' representations towards the mean values of the distractors,
% with more shift occuring if the distractors are closer together/closer to
% the target.
%
% In addition to data.errors, the data struct should include:
%   data.distractors, Row 1: distance of distractor 1 from target
%   ...
%   data.distractors, Row N: distance of distractor N from target
%
% Note that these values are the *distance from the correct answer*, not
% the actual color values of the distractors. They should thus range from
% -180 to 180. 
%
% data.distractors may contain NaNs. For example, if you have data with 
% different set sizes, data.distractors should contain as many rows as you
% need for the largest set size, and for displays with smaller set sizes
% the last several rows can be filled with NaNs.
%
% This is a simplified version of the Brady & Alvarez (2011) model, in that
% it does not take into account noise in the sampling of the distractors,
% and allows only a single level of integration (with all distractors).
