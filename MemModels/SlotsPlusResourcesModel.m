% SLOTSPLUSRESOURCESMODEL returns a structure for the slots+resources model of
% Zhang & Luck (2008), though it assumes even allocation of the resource to
% whichever objects are assigned a slot. The model has two parameters: capacity,
% which is the number of available slots, and bestSD, which is the standard 
% deviation of memory for an item when all of the resource is thrown at it.
% model with capacity K and precision sd.
%
% In addition to data.errors, this requires data.n (the set size for each
% trial). The model is not particularly well-formed unless you have tested
% multiple set sizes; with only a single set size you may be better off
% with a model that does not make predictions across set size, like
% StandardMixtureModel().
%
% Uses the capacity and bestSD to fit data across multiple sizes. 
%
% A prior probability distribution can be specified in model.prior. Example
% priors are available in MemModels/Priors.
