% EXPONENTIALDECAYMODEL returns a struct for a model where objects drop out
% of memory indepdendently at a constant rate over time, somewhat like the
% model proposed by Zhang & Luck (2009), though without an initial period of
% stability. (This is a pure death process over objects.)
%
% Parameters: tau, K, sd
%   Tau is the mean lifetime of an object (in ms), K is the capacity of 
%   working memory, and sd is the precision with which items are remembered. 
% 
% In addition to data.errors, requires data.n (the set size for each trial)
% as well as data.time (the delay before test in each trial; in milliseconds).

  % To specify a prior probability distribution, change and uncomment 
  % the following line, where p is a vector of parameter values, arranged 
  % in the same order that they appear in model.paramNames:
