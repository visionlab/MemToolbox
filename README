MemToolbox 1.0.0.

The MemToolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions for modeling visual
working memory. In support of its goal to provide a full suite of data
analysis tools, the toolbox includes implementations of popular models of
visual working memory, real and simulated data sets, Bayesian and maximum
likelihood estimation procedures for fitting models to data,
visualizations of data and fit, validation routines, model comparison
metrics, and experiment scripts. The MemToolbox is released under a BSD
license and is freely available.

If you wish to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your 
research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed using the 
MemToolbox (Suchow, Brady, Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013; memtoolbox.org)." and 
then cite:

Dependencies:
1. The Statistics Toolbox (http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/) is
   needed for all of the major functionality of the toolbox.
2. The Psychophysics Toolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org) is needed only for 
   the experiment scripts in MemExperiments.
